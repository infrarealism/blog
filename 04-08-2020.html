<h1>iOS</h1>
<p>A few months ago I started the project Ari.</p>
<p>My main motivation was mainly that I'm awful at creating websites, and sometimes I just want to create something simple and plain, but even for that it is a task with lots of copy pasting and trying to remember how I did it a previous time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to start the project as a macOS app, thinking that at some point a porting to iOS would make total sense.</p>
<p>After a few months the macOS app is ready, it might be very far from perfect, but it works and it is already published.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now has come the time to decide if this project is good enough to continue supporting it or it is better to stop lying to myself and instead focus on something else; more importantly it is time to define if an iOS app of Ari could be useful at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my own doubts on this, but hopefully I will find out soon.</p>
